A Resume Builder is a web or mobile application designed to help users create, edit, and download professional resumes with ease. It typically includes user-friendly features such as customizable templates, guided sections for different resume components (e.g., work experience, education, skills), and tools to preview and export resumes in various formats (e.g., PDF).

The goal is to provide a streamlined, intuitive interface that enables users to craft resumes tailored to specific industries or job applications, incorporating best practices for resume writing and design.

If you're creating this as a UX project, you might focus on:

User Needs: Simplify the resume creation process, provide professional design options, and allow for easy editing and exporting.
Unique Features: Real-time feedback on resume quality, integration with job descriptions for keyword suggestions, and accessibility for diverse users.
